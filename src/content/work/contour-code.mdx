Contour Code is a system that encodes text in compositions of 2<span class='sc'>D</span> geometric shapes. For example, this says “sleep”:

<Box factor={1.5} top={2} bottom={1.5}>
  <Img src='contour-code/sleep.png' uses='ftpb' alt=''/>
</Box>

I had two goals in designing this system: first, to produce beautiful abstractions along the lines of Alexander Calder and Ellsworth Kelly, and second, to make a code flexible enough that any possible set of geometric shapes can be “read” as text. To achieve these goals, I designed a procedure for converting between compositions of shapes and strings of characters. In this design process, I aimed to maximize the beauty of the shapes, the elegance of the algorithm, and the system’s ease of use. Contour Code is the result of a conversation between these three values.

## Instructions

To read a composition, shapes are traced to produce a sequence of straight, concave, and convex sides, and that sequence is interpreted as letters using a system like Morse Code. This video explains the basics: 

<div class="media" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/902052983?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Contour Code"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

The complete encoding referenced in the video is shown below. **A** is convex–concave; **B** is concave–straight–convex–convex; etc.

When reading a shape, you can use this diagram to convert from encodings back to letters.

[This document](</public/work/contour-code/Contour Code shape reading order.pdf>) describes how to order the shapes and sides when reading them.

Contour Code was included in the juried exhibition [Quasi: Experimental Writing Systems](https://hmctartcenter.org/exhibitions/quasi-experimental-writing-systems/) at ArtCenter College of Design.
