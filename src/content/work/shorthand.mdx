This is my tool for fast writing, self-reflection, and expressive lettering.

My original goal was to design a form of shorthand that would be easier for me to learn than existing systems. Toward this goal, I based the system on existing English spelling, kept the rules relatively simple, and took advantage of muscle memory from typing on a <span class='sc'>QWERTY</span> keyboard. After using this system for a bit, I discovered that in addition to letting me write faster, it also quiets my internal editor: as it’s a bit harder to read than regular writing, I am able to look at the words I’ve just written without immediately perceiving their meaning. This makes for a more meditative writing experience than using the regular alphabet.

Because the system allows me to write quickly and with less self-judgment, I found it useful for journaling, and so I have used it extensively in the years since I designed it. Writing a few thousand pages of text has made me comfortable using this system expressively and exploring various lettering styles.

## Instructions


Here is the word "introduce":

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/introduce.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

The parts correspond to the letters as follows:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/introduce letters.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

Notice that the consonants are a series of lines connected in various ways, while the vowels are separate symbols floating above or below. I’ll start by describing how consonants work, then move on to vowels.

### Consonants

At its core, every consonant is built around a single line. These lines can be angled in one of three directions:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/line directions.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

The length of the line and the amount of straightness or curvature don’t matter. These are all the same (slant up):

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/slant up variations.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

These lines can be connected or related to each other in various ways. Here are the consonants from “introduce,” with their directions and connection types labeled:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/introduce directions & connections.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

These two features — direction and connection type — together determine the letter. More specifically, every consonant letter is defined by a combination of:
- A line direction
- The way the line connects to the previous line

For example, in “introduce”:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/introduce consonants.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

(What about N, which doesn’t have a previous line? I’ll get to that in a moment.)

There are 7 connection types:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/connection types slant flat.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

That image shows how these connection types work between a slanted line and a flat line. They work similarly in other contexts:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/connection types incomplete.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

What about an angle connection between a flat line and another flat line? Or between any two lines going in the same direction?

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/angle connection try.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

Drawing them like that won't work, because there’s no way to tell that it’s supposed to be two lines — it just looks like one long line. So in this case, to keep a visible angle, draw a vertical line.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/connection types.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

So a vertical line connected to a line before it means, “This is a separate consonant, but imagine this is going in the same direction as the line before it.”

Now that I’ve described how the 3 directions and 7 connections interact, here’s the complete set of consonants with their direction and connection type:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/consonant chart.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

With one exception (J), the direction of a consonant corresponds to the row of a <span class='sc'>QWERTY</span> keyboard the letter is on: the top row slants up, the middle row is flat, and the bottom row slants down.

The line representing the first consonant in a word does not have any line before it to connect to. Instead, each type of connection has an alternate form when it’s at the start of a word:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/initial forms.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

If it helps to remember, you can think of the vertical line in **jump up** and **jump down** as a representation of the jump itself. For **jump right** and **jump left**, you can remember that the beginning curves right or left correspondingly.

The loops for R, C, and H don’t have to go around all the way; they just have to curl around enough to distinguish them from P, B, and D.

Note that vertical lines are used in two different ways:
- To write T, N, or S when they come after another consonant going in the same direction
- To write Q, M, F, W, Z, or L at the beginning of a word

Some examples of these vertical lines:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/verticals.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

That completes all the rules for consonants. To write words, we also need:

### Vowels

Vowels are written as marks, somewhat like accents, above and below the consonant lines.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/vowels.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

Note that Y is included both here and in the consonant chart. In contexts where Y is used as a consonant (*you*, *yes*), it is written as a consonant, while in contexts where it is used as a vowel (*my*, *say*), it is written as a vowel. Usually it’s a vowel.

Each vowel is drawn above/below whichever consonant is most directly before it. Vowels at the beginning of a word are drawn above/below the space before the beginning of the first consonant.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/vowel placement.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

If a word starts with a consonant, I tend to write all the consonants first and then go back and add the vowels. If a word starts with a vowel, I usually write the initial vowel, then all the consonants, then any other vowels. (That’s just what I find easiest.) I did not find it too hard to get used to writing the letters out of order like this.

At this point we’ve seen enough to fully interpret “introduce” from earlier! Here it is again — notice how the vowels are placed:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/introduce.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

Consecutive vowels could be written by putting the vowels left to right:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/consecutive vowels.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

But to speed things up, the system also has ligatures that combine pairs of vowels into one symbol, which I recommend using. Generally the directions of the two endpoints of the ligature represent the two vowels: A and E are horizontal ends, I and O are vertical or sometimes diagonal ends, and U and Y are ends that curl around at least 180°.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/ligature chart.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

All of these can be stretched or bent to fit into the context better, as long as the ends are pointing in the right directions.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/ligature variation.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

There can also be ligatures three vowels, although I don’t think there are good solutions for every possible combination — I just come up with them when I need them.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/three vowel ligatures.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

Most of these have hard angles in them, which are needed to distinguish them from similar two-vowel ligatures:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/three vowel disambiguation.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

In some edge cases, things are just too tight to be completely unambiguous, and some parts have to go in the “wrong” place. In these cases you just have to tell from context.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/edge cases.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

### Punctuation and numbers

Most of the punctuation is formed by replacing dots with circles, so it stands out more and doesn’t get confused with the word “a” (which is just a dot). All punctuation is written aligned to the center of the text line, like ○ rather than ○.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/punctuation.svg' uses='f' alt=''/>

Numerals are written normally. (This does mean that 6 looks like a quote and 9 looks like a comma, but it should be clear from context.)

### Fast and expressive writing

As I’ve gotten more comfortable reading and writing in this system quickly, the shapes have changed and become more fluid, sometimes to the extent that a literal reading of the shapes would give different text. Here are some types of changes that have happened:

In general, everything becomes more expressive:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/earlier.png' uses='f' alt=''/>
<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/question.png' uses='f' alt=''/>

Ligatures in particular become larger and more loopy:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/way.png' uses='f' alt=''/>
<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/anyone.png' uses='f' alt=''/>
<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/experience.png' uses='f' alt=''/>

The directions of lines become looser; there may be a “flat” line that is actually slanted, but it still reads as flat because it is less slanted than the other lines around it.

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/conversation.png' uses='f' alt=''/>
<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/walk.png' uses='f' alt=''/>

Angles become softer:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/things.png' uses='f' alt=''/>

Separate parts start to connect:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/feelings.png' uses='f' alt=''/>
<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/to.png' uses='f' alt=''/>
<Img src="shorthand/instructions/examples/doesn't.png" uses='f' alt=''/>

(Reading literally, these would say *feeilngs*, *tt*, and *doysnt*.)

Nearby vowels cluster together, to the extent that a vowel may not be aligned with the right consonant anymore:

<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/however.png' uses='f' alt=''/>
<Img src='shorthand/instructions/examples/imagining.png' uses='f' alt=''/>

(Reading this literally, both of the i’s are above the g, so this says *imagiinng*. However, I still consider this unambiguous: if the two i’s were actually in a row in the word, they would be written as a ligature. The fact that they are not in a ligature here means they must be part of separate syllables.)

To emphasize a word, you can elongate it:

## stuff

In English, multiple letters are often used to represent a single sound, so most shorthand systems speed things up by writing the sounds of words rather than spellings. However, people aren’t used to writing words phonetically, and I imagine that in learning traditional shorthand systems, it could take a while to wrap one’s mind around this new way of thinking. Since I wanted a system that would be easy for me to learn, I chose to represent spellings rather than sounds, even though that makes it less efficient.

Also, from what I understand, traditional shorthand systems require a fine degree of motor control: when writing a line, you might need to keep in mind its length, direction, amount of curvature, and sometimes even width, all while writing at a rapid pace. In my system, once you’re writing a line, all you have to care about is what direction it’s going — how long it is and how much it bends are up to your whims. However, where lines meet each other, your hand naturally slows down to let you change direction, and so this seemed a better place to introduce finer distinctions in shape.

These thoughts led me to a system where consonants are written as a series of lines from left to right, pointing in one three directions (horizontal, slanted up, or slanted down). These lines can be directly attached to each other, connect using a loop or zigzag, or be separated by a horizontal or vertical gap. The combination of the direction of the line and the type of connection indicates the letter. To take advantage of preexisting muscle memory, the direction is determined by which row of a QWERTY keyboard the letter is on, and to optimize speed, more common letters are written using simpler types of connections. Vowels and combinations of vowels are written as diacritics above, below, or through the consonant lines.
