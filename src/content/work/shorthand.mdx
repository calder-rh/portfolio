This is my tool for fast writing, self-reflection, and expressive lettering.

My original goal was to design a form of shorthand that would be easier for me to learn than existing systems. Toward this goal, I based the system on existing English spelling, kept the rules relatively simple, and took advantage of muscle memory from typing on a <span class='sc'>QWERTY</span> keyboard. After using this system for a bit, I discovered that in addition to letting me write faster, it also quiets my internal editor: as it’s a bit harder to read than regular writing, I am able to look at the words I’ve just written without immediately perceiving their meaning. This makes for a more meditative writing experience than using the regular alphabet.

Because the system allows me to write quickly and with less self-judgment, I found it useful for journaling, and so I have used it extensively in the years since I designed it. Writing a few thousand pages of text has made me comfortable using this system expressively and exploring various lettering styles.

### Introduction

In English, multiple letters are often used to represent a single sound, so most shorthand systems speed things up by writing the sounds of words rather than spellings. However, people aren’t used to writing words phonetically, and I imagine that in learning traditional shorthand systems, it could take a while to wrap one’s mind around this new way of thinking. Since I wanted a system that would be easy for me to learn, I chose to represent spellings rather than sounds, even though that makes it less efficient.

Also, from what I understand, traditional shorthand systems require a fine degree of motor control: when writing a line, you might need to keep in mind its length, direction, amount of curvature, and sometimes even width, all while writing at a rapid pace. In my system, once you’re writing a line, all you have to care about is what direction it’s going — how long it is and how much it bends are up to your whims. However, where lines meet each other, your hand naturally slows down to let you change direction, and so this seemed a better place to introduce finer distinctions in shape.

These thoughts led me to a system where consonants are written as a series of lines from left to right, pointing in one three directions (horizontal, slanted up, or slanted down). These lines can be directly attached to each other, connect using a loop or zigzag, or be separated by a horizontal or vertical gap. The combination of the direction of the line and the type of connection indicates the letter. To take advantage of preexisting muscle memory, the direction is determined by which row of a QWERTY keyboard the letter is on, and to optimize speed, more common letters are written using simpler types of connections. Vowels and combinations of vowels are written as diacritics above, below, or through the consonant lines.
