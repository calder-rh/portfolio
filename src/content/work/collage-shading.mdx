For the last few years I have been working alongside [Barb Meier](https://cs.brown.edu/people/bjm/) and my peers from her computer animation courses to make a short film, which partly takes place in an alternate world inspired by a child’s drawings. To create an effect of being inside a drawing, I designed and implemented a non-photorealistic shading system in Maya that renders <span class="lining">3D</span> objects as a collage of flat textures. The film is still in production, but here are a few early tests I made while working out the kinks:

<Box factor={2}>
  <MuxPlayer
    playbackId="Pg6hTFwPw802fDAhgQX5bHzFzBvTToN92wzgtsgHOiOM"
    metadata={{ video_title: 'Flower set' }}
    preferPlayback="mse"
    primaryColor="#e5e7eb"
    accentColor="#60889a"
  />
</Box>

<Box factor={2}>
  <MuxPlayer
    playbackId="5qd28rEfTNPf53B00obRUDWIzm4Jo1jzLya9yqT4gD8I"
    metadata={{ video_title: 'Bird' }}
    preferPlayback="mse"
    primaryColor="#e5e7eb"
    accentColor="#60889a"
  />
</Box>

## Behind the scenes

In normal <span class="lining">3D</span> rendering, textures wrap around objects and follow the rules of perspective:

<Box factor={.4}>
  <Img src='collage-shading/regular cylinder.png' uses='f' alt=""/>
</Box>

My collage shading system does not do this; rather, textures stay flat on the screen, regardless of how the surface is shaped or how you’re looking at it:

<Box factor={.4}>
  <Img src='collage-shading/collage cylinder.png' uses='f' alt=""/>
</Box>

These flat textures move, rotate, and scale to follow the surface as it moves across the screen:

<Box>
  <MuxPlayer
    playbackId="9SxUWslZVnYSaV5wp6M66Jd9dUG8ol3Qk2xeMmIVHjs"
    metadata={{ video_title: 'Cylinder movement' }}
    preferPlayback="mse"
    primaryColor="#e5e7eb"
    accentColor="#60889a"
  />
</Box>

Some more technical details:

Each of the three sides of the cylinder is filled with its own flat texture image (a camera projection). I call each of these surface regions a *facet*. Each texture moves across the screen to track a particular point in its facet, and orients itself to (the projection of) a vector in the facet’s transformation space.

The shading network is generated based on an input image, which specifies all the parameters of the shader. To create this image, I start by painting unique colors on the model’s UV map to specify the boundaries of the facets. Then within each facet, I add patterns of specially-colored pixels that specify which texture files to use, how the projections should be oriented to follow the <span class="lining">3D</span> surface, and how much to blur between facets. My software then interprets that image to generate the shading network. Here’s the image that generated the bird’s shader:
