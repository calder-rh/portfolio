Our base-ten numeral system represents numbers by taking powers of ten, multiplying them by various factors, and adding the results together: for example, <span style="white-space: nowrap">936 = __9__ × 10² + __3__ × 10¹ + __6__ × 10⁰.</span> This is good for practical calculations, but mathematically, it’s a rather arbitrary way to represent numbers. There’s nothing inherently special about ten; it’s just the number of fingers most people happen to have.

A more natural way to represent an integer is its prime factorization, a set of prime numbers raised to various powers and multiplied together: <span style="white-space: nowrap">936 = 2³ × 3² × 13¹.</span> This is like breaking a number down into its atomic parts: for every number, there is exactly one way to break it down into primes, and this factorization gives some fundamental information about how the number behaves in various mathematical contexts.

When we write a number’s prime factorization as we did above, we are still using base ten. In that previous example, <span style="white-space: nowrap">2³ × 3² × 13¹</span>, the “13” means <span style="white-space: nowrap">__1__ × 10¹ + __3__ × 10⁰</span>, and even the other single-digit primes and exponents are ultimately written in base 10. Recursive Prime Numeral System is a way of writing a prime factorization without any hint of base ten or any other base: everything is written using primes.

My first thought in designing this system was that all the numbers making up the prime factorization could themselves broken down into factors: for example, if a factorization contains 13⁴, the power 4 can be written as 2². However, the 13 can’t be broken down any further into factors — that’s what it means to be prime.

But if we represent 13 using its *index* — 6, as it’s the 6th prime number — then we get something that can be broken down further: 6 = 2¹ × 3¹. We can continue this process by representing 2 and 3 using their indices as well:

<Equation align="25%">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="lhs">6</div>
    <div class="rel">=</div>
    <div class="rhs"><span class="blue">2¹</span> × <span class="blue">3¹</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="lhs"></div>
    <div class="rel">=</div>
    <div class="rhs"><span class="blue"><Group>(the 1st prime ^ 1)</Group></span> <Group>× <span class="blue">(the 2nd prime ^ 1)</span></Group></div>
  </div>
</Equation>

The 2 in that expression can be broken down in the same way:

<Equation align="25%">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="lhs">6</div>
    <div class="rel">=</div>
    <div class="rhs"><Group>(the 1st prime ^ 1)</Group> <Group>× (the <span class="blue">(the 1st prime ^ 1)</span>th prime ^ 1)</Group></div>
  </div>
</Equation>

Now that we have this expression for 6, we can use it to write 13:

<Equation align="10%">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="lhs">13</div>
    <div class="rel">=</div>
    <div class="rhs">(the <span class="blue">6</span>th prime ^ 1)</div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="lhs"></div>
    <div class="rel">=</div>
    <div class="rhs">(the <span class="blue">((the 1st prime ^ 1) × (the (the 1st prime ^ 1)th prime ^ 1))</span>th prime ^ 1)</div>
  </div>
</Equation>

This cannot be broken down any further, as the only numbers remaining are 1’s.



Write the prime factorization:

<p class="center">45 = 3² × 5¹</p>

3 is the second prime, and 5 is the third prime, so we can refer to these primes using their indices:

<p class="center">45 = (the 2nd prime ^ 2) × (the 3rd prime ^ 1)</p>

This expression contains four numbers: 2, 2, 3, and 1. We can’t do anything more with the 1, but the others we can break down further. Let’s start with the 3. The prime factorization of 3 is simply 3¹, but we break that into smaller numbers by writing 3 using its index:

<p class="center">45 = (the 2nd prime ^ 2) × (the <span style="color: var(--dark-blue);">(the 2nd prime ^ 1)</span>st prime ^ 1)</p>

Now we have three 2’s left. 2 is (the 1st prime ^ 1), so:

45 = (the <span style="color: var(--dark-blue);">(the 1st prime ^ 1)</span>st prime ^ <span style="color: var(--dark-blue);">(the 1st prime ^ 1)</span>) × (the (the <span style="color: var(--dark-blue);">(the 1st prime ^ 1)</span>st prime ^ 1)st prime ^ 1)

This becomes unreadable pretty quickly. Let’s make it simpler by using “A ◊ B” to mean “the A-th prime to the power of B”:

<p class="center">45 = ((1 ◊ 1) ◊ (1 ◊ 1)) × (((1 ◊ 1) ◊ 1) ◊ 1)</p>

If you continue breaking numbers into prime indices and exponents and factoring those, you eventually get to an expression involving only ones combined in different ways. Using “A ◊ B” to mean “the A-th prime to the power of B,” we can write something like

<p class="center">936 = (1 ◊ ((1 ◊ 1) ◊ 1)) × ((1 ◊ 1) ◊ (1 ◊ 1)) × (((1 ◊ 1) × ((1 ◊ 1) ◊ 1)) ◊ 1).</p>

This result met my original goal — representing numbers in a way that only uses primes — but visually, it’s not very clear, since you have to keep track of all those parentheses. I realized that this type of structure, with nested expressions of different types, could be represented more clearly by using a specially designed notation in two dimensions.

Creating such a notation involves two decisions: how to visually represent A × B, and how to represent A ◊ B. I have tried a number of ideas for each of these operations, producing a variety of visual results. Some of these designs have more mathematical value (clearly representing the operations involved), while others have more artistic value (producing beautiful shapes). “Dots & Lines” is one of the more mathematically-oriented designs (drawing horizontal and vertical lines to indicate the different operations), while “Colored Rectangles” is one of the more artistically-oriented ones (placing shapes near each other, touching each other, or inside each other to represent the operations, and coloring them however I please).
