Resolution Code is an evolution of the ideas that prompted me to design [Contour Code]('/work/contouur-code). My original hope with Contour Code was that it could be used to assign meaning to any shape in one’s environment. However, I soon realized that it only works for crisp geometric shapes; most shapes from the real world are too rough or complicated for it to handle. I set out to create a more flexible system that can interpret a fractal just as easily as it interprets a circle. Resolution Code can do this, and it can also encode any given text into a shape, which will usually end up being a fractal. While Contour Code can represent a given text in many different ways depending on the artistic whims of the user, Resolution Code has exactly one way to represent any piece of text. In mathematical terms, it is a bijection between shapes (defined loosely) and strings of characters.

The reason Contour Code struggles to interpret many shapes from the real world stems from the way it represents shapes. The system depends on the ability to divide the outline of a shape into series of smooth (straight or curved) segments demarcated by sharp corners. However, most natural objects are rough everywhere with no smooth segments, and most artificial objects are smooth everywhere with no fully sharp corners. To interpret such a shape with Contour Code, one must approximate the shape as a series of smooth segments. This is like tracing a complicated reference image in a vector graphics editor: given the same image, a hundred people would trace it in a hundred different ways, and in Contour Code, each of those options would represent a different string of characters. I wanted a system where any shape corresponds to exactly one string of characters, without requiring any subjective choices. Resolution Code does this by taking an approach inspired by raster graphics instead of vector graphics: a shape is defined not by its outline but by the pixels it covers.

The simplest way to use pixels to interpret a shape would be to define some preset resolution, create an image of the shape at that resolution, and then read off the rows of pixels from top to bottom, creating a string of binary digits where a one indicates a pixel inside the shape and a zero indicates a pixel outside the shape. Then use a text encoding to convert that binary string to a string of characters. This is not satisfactory for a few reasons. First, the text produced by the system depends on the resolution of the image, which is an arbitrary subjective choice. Second, an image at any fixed resolution is incapable of representing detail beyond a certain scale, and so two shapes that are different at a small scale would turn into the same string of text. Finally, any solid enough shape would produce long strings of ones (when many pixels
in a row are inside the shape) followed by long strings of zeros (when many pixels in a row are outside the shape), which would result in the same few characters being repeated over and over.

Resolution Code addresses all of these issues. Rather than using one fixed resolution of image, it represents a shape using a sequence of images at higher and higher resolutions: first 2×2, then 4×4, then 8×8, and so on to infinity, doubling each time. The system represents each of these images as binary digits and appends the digits to an ever-growing string. However, rather than appending the bits for the whole image, it only records the parts that have gained detail since the last iteration: the pixels at the edge of the shape, which are divided into four smaller pixels that represent the edge with more detail. All the other pixels give no new information since last time and don’t need to be written down. The resulting string of binary digits has an even mix of zeros and ones and can be used to reconstruct the shape at an arbitrarily high level of detail.

To this core idea I have been adding refinements, each to achieve a certain aesthetic goal:
- The system also works the other way, to input text and output a shape. To ensure that the output actually looks like a shape, and not just a set of squares stuck to each other, I had to impose some conditions on how each pixel is allowed to be subdivided depending on the pixels touching it.
- These conditions had the side effect of greatly increasing the amount of negative space, creating a light dusting of specks instead of bigger shapes. To counteract this, I apply another encoding to the beginning of the sequence to weight it more heavily with ones over zeros, as that creates more positive space.
- Since the system works by first describing the large-scale structure and then going into finer and finer detail, the first bits (and thus the first characters) have an outsize impact on the shape, while later parts of the string determine nearly indiscernible details. When encoding text, I want every character to have equal influence over the shape. To achieve this, I can have the system apply a transformation inspired by Fourier analysis and checksums to create a new sequence of bits that represents the same information in a more spread-out way.
