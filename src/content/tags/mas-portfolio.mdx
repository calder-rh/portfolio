# MAS portfolio

**CRH Shorthand** is an example of one of my writing systems; **Contour Code** and **Resolution Code** are the systems I describe in my essay that represent text with a more diverse range of visuals. The **VAoLM** page is one of my explorations to further this thread of work, toward the vision I describe in the essay.

All of those works are manifestations of the theme of experiencing something in a new form; the **music animation** is a different manifestation of the same theme. The **shading system** is an example of a more complex software project.

Some of these works have explanatory videos or writing associated with them; feel free to engage with these as much or as little as you choose.
