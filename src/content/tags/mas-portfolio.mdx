# MAS portfolio

**CRH Shorthand** is an example of one of my writing systems; **Contour Code** and **Resolution Code** are the systems I describe in my essay that represent text with a more diverse range of visuals. The **music-driven animation** and **Recursive Prime Numeral System** do not represent language, but they manifest the same theme of presenting something in a new form. I am also including the **shading system** as an example of a more complex software project.

Some of these works have explanatory videos or writing associated with them; feel free to engage with these as much or as little as you choose.
