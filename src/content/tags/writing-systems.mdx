# Writing systems

A *writing system* is a system for representing a language using symbols, such as the Latin alphabet that you’re reading now. Other writing systems include the Arabic alphabet and Chinese characters. The works on this page are alternate writing systems for English — other ways of visually representing the language, for various artistic or practical purposes.
