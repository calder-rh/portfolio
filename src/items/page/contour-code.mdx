Contour Code is a system that encodes text in compositions of 2<span class='sc'>D</span> geometric shapes.

I had two goals in designing this system: first, to produce beautiful abstractions along the lines of Alexander Calder and Ellsworth Kelly, and second, to make a code flexible enough that any possible set of geometric shapes can be “read” as text. To achieve these goals, I designed a procedure for converting between compositions of shapes and strings of characters. In this design process, I aimed to maximize the beauty of the shapes, the elegance of the algorithm, and the system’s ease of use. Contour Code is the result of a conversation between these three values.

## Instructions

To read a composition, shapes are traced to produce a sequence of straight, concave, and convex sides, and that sequence is interpreted as letters using a system like Morse Code. This video explains the basics: 

<div class="spaced-media" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/902052983?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Contour Code"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

The complete encoding referenced in the video is shown below. **A** is convex–concave; **B** is concave–straight–convex–convex; etc.

<Box factor={1.5} top={1} bottom={1}>

</Box>

I have also experimented with several other options for encodings, which use three sides for every character rather than the variable number of sides in the encoding above. One of those newer encodings is used to spell the “unconsciousness” piece above. (When I decide which I prefer I’ll add it to this page.)

{/* When reading a shape, you can use this diagram to convert from encodings back to letters.

[This document](</public/work/contour-code/Contour Code shape reading order.pdf>) describes how to order the shapes and sides when reading them.

Contour Code was included in the juried exhibition [Quasi: Experimental Writing Systems](https://hmctartcenter.org/exhibitions/quasi-experimental-writing-systems/) at ArtCenter College of Design.
