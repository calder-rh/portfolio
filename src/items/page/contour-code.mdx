Contour Code is a system that encodes text in compositions of shapes. To read a composition, shapes are traced to produce a sequence of straight, concave, and convex sides, and that sequence is interpreted as letters using a system like Morse Code. Click any of the pieces below to see a diagram of this process. (Full explanation coming soon!)
